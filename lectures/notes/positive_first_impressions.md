# Predictability

The user should be able to anticipate the natural progression of each task.  
–– Provide distinct and recognizable screen elements.  
–– Provide cues to the result of an action to be performed.  
Do not bundle or combine actions.  
All expectations should be fulfilled uniformly and completely.  

# Recovery

A system should permit:  
–– Commands or actions to be abolished or reversed.  
–– Immediate return to a certain point if difficulties arise.  
Ensure that users never lose their work as a result of:  
–– An error on their part. 
–– Hardware, software, or communication problems.  

# Responsiveness

The system must rapidly respond to the user’s requests.  
Provide immediate acknowledgment for all user actions:  
–– Visual.  
–– Textual.  
–– Auditory.  

# Safety

Protect the user from making mistakes.
–– Provide visual cues, reminders, lists of choices, and other aids either automatically or upon request.

# Simplicity

Provide as simple an interface as possible.  
Ways to provide simplicity:  
–– Use progressive disclosure, hiding things until they are needed.  
• Present common and necessary functions first.  
• Prominently feature important functions.  
• Hide more sophisticated and less frequently used functions.  
–– Provide an obvious visual hierarchy.  
–– Provide defaults.  
–– Minimize screen alignment points.  
–– Make common actions simple at the expense of uncommon actions being made harder.  
–– Provide uniformity and consistency.  
–– Eliminate unnecessary elements.  

# Transparency

Permit the user to focus on the task or job, without concern for the mechanics of the interface.  
–– Workings and reminders of workings inside the computer should be invisible to the user.  

# Trade-Offs

Final design will be based on a series of trade-offs balancing often-conflicting design principles.  
People’s requirements always take precedence over technical requirements.  

# Visibility

A system’s status and methods of use must be clearly visible.  
Improve visibility through:  
–– Hierarchical organization.  
–– Context sensitivity.
