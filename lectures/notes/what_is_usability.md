# Usability

Much of the development process will focus on the concept of system usability. Usability is a quality attribute that assesses how easy a user interface is to use. The term usability also refers to methods for improving ease-of-use throughout the entire design process.

Bennett (1979) was the first to use the term usability to describe the effectiveness of human performance. In the following years a more formal definition was proposed by Shackel (1981) and modified by Bennett (1984). Shackel (1991) simply defined usability as “the capability to be used by humans easily and effectively, where,  
* easily = to a specified level of subjective assessment,
* effectively = to a specified level of human performance.”

In recent years more specific descriptions have been presented. Nielsen (2003) suggests usability possess these five quality components:

* **Learnability**: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?
* **Efficiency**: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?
* **Memorability**: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?
* **Errors**: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily can they recover from the errors?
* **Satisfaction**: How pleasant is it to use the design?

## Common Usability Problems

Mandel (1994) lists the 10 most common usability problems in graphical systems as reported by IBM usability specialists. They are:  
1. Ambiguous menus and icons.
2. Languages that permit only single-direction movement through a system.
3. Input and direct manipulation limits.
4. Highlighting and selection limitations.
5. Unclear step sequences.
6. More steps to manage the interface than to perform tasks.
7. Complex linkage between and within applications.
8. Inadequate feedback and confirmation.
9. Lack of system anticipation and intelligence.
10. Inadequate error messages, help, tutorials, and documentation.

## Possible Usability Measurement Criteria

Tyldesley (1988) and Shackel (1991) have both presented possible objective criteria for measuring usability.

1. Time to complete a task.
2. Percentage of task completed.
3. Percentage of task completed per unit time (speed metric).
4. Ratio of successes to failures.
5. Time spent on errors.
6. Percentage of number of errors.
7. Percentage of number of competitors that do this better than the current product.
8. Number of commands used.
9. Frequency of help or documentation use.
10. Time spent using help or documentation.
11. Percentage of favorable to unfavorable user commands.
12. Number of repetitions of failed commands.
13. Number of runs of success and of failures.
14. Number of times the interface misleads the user.
15. Number of good and bad features recalled by users.
16. Number of available commands not invoked.
17. Number of regressive behaviors.
18. Number of users preferring your system.
19. Number of times users need to work around a problem.
20. Number of times the user is distracted from a work task.
21. Number of times the user loses control of a system.
22. Number of times the user expresses frustration or satisfaction.
