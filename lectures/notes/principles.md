# Accessibility

Systems should be designed to be usable, without modification, by as many people as possible.  

# Aesthetically Pleasing

Provide visual appeal by following these presentation and graphic design principles:  
–– Provide meaningful contrast between screen elements.  
–– Create groupings.  
–– Align screen elements and groups.  
–– Provide three-dimensional representation.  
–– Use color and graphics effectively and simply.  

# Availability

Make all objects available at all times.  
Avoid the use of modes.  

# Clarity

The interface should be visually, conceptually, and linguistically clear including:  
–– Visual elements  
–– Functions  
–– Metaphors  
–– Words and text  

# Compatibility

Provide compatibility with the following:  
–– The user  
–– The task and job  
–– The product  
Adopt the user’s perspective.  

# Configurability

Permit easy personalization, configuration, and reconfiguration of settings to do the following:  
–– Enhance a sense of control.  
–– Encourage an active role in understanding.  

# Consistency

A system should look, act, and operate the same throughout. Similar components should:  
–– Have a similar look.  
–– Have similar uses.  
–– Operate similarly.  
The same action should always yield the same result.  
The function of elements should not change.  
The position of standard elements should not change.  

# Control

The user must control the interaction.  
–– Actions should result from explicit user requests.  
–– Actions should be performed quickly.  
–– Actions should be capable of interruption or termination.  
–– The user should never be interrupted for errors.  
The context maintained must be from the perspective of the user.  
The means to achieve goals should be flexible and compatible with the user’s skills, experiences, habits, and preferences.  
Avoid modes because they constrain the actions available to the user.  
Permit the user to customize aspects of the interface, while always providing a proper set of defaults.  

# Directness

Provide direct ways to accomplish tasks.  
–– Available alternatives should be visible.  
–– The effect of actions on objects should be visible.  

# Efficiency

Minimize eye and hand movements, and other control actions.  
–– Transitions between various system controls should flow easily and freely.  
–– Navigation paths should be as short as possible.  
–– Eye movement through a screen should be obvious and sequential.  
Anticipate the user’s wants and needs whenever possible.  

# Familiarity

Employ familiar concepts and use a language that is familiar to the user.  
Keep the interface natural, mimicking the user’s behavior patterns.  
Use real-world metaphors.  

# Flexibility

A system must be sensitive to the differing needs of its users, enabling a level and type of performance based upon:  
–– Each user’s knowledge and skills.  
–– Each user’s experience.  
–– Each user’s personal preference.  
–– Each user’s habits.  
–– The conditions at that moment.  

# Forgiveness

Tolerate and forgive common and unavoidable human errors.  
Prevent errors from occurring whenever possible.  
Protect against possible catastrophic errors.  
Provide constructive messages when an error does occur.  

# Immersion

Foster immersion within tasks.

# Obviousness

A system should be easily learned and understood. A user should know the following:  
–– What to look at  
–– What it is  
–– What to do  
–– When to do it  
–– Where to do it  
–– Why to do it  
–– How to do it  
The flow of actions, responses, visual presentations, and information should be in a sensible order that is easy to recollect and place in context.  

# Operability

Ensure that a system’s design can be used by everyone, regardless of physical
abilities.    

# Perceptibility

Assure that a system’s design can be perceived, regardless of a person’s sensory
abilities.
