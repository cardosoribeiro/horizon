# AALP - A framework for navigation design

## Analysis

The goal in this phase is to understand the problem you’re trying to solve before setting out to design. 

    * This initial phase focuses on understanding the problem you're trying to solve.
    * It stresses the importance of thorough research and avoiding premature design decisions.
    * The goal is to gather insights that will inform the entire navigation design process.

It’s tempting to dive into the details of a design as soon as the project starts. People will start talking about button placement, labels, and even color as soon as a project begins. Resist this urge. Understand the problem first. The amount and type of analysis you perform at the outset will influence navigation design throughout the project. It’s like hitting a golf ball: the slightest deviation up front has a huge effect on the final trajectory.

## Architecture

The purpose here is to determine how to best structure the site. Even if the site’s architecture already exists, you’ll still need to understand basic principles of organization and categorization to design an appropriate navigation. 

    * This phase deals with the site's overall structure and organization.
    * It involves determining how to categorize and organize content to facilitate easy navigation.
    * Even if the site's architecture is pre-existing, understanding organizational principles is essential.

Imagine you’re planning a trip to Paris in the spring and coincidentally see an online advertisement for what looks like a good package price—better than what you’ve been able to find so far. You click on the ad and land on the home page of a travel service you’ve never heard of, but that appears reputable nonetheless. A quick scan of the teasers in the middle of page reveals that none of them are for the Paris trip you want. One of them is for something called Europe Tours, but that doesn’t seem right and sounds like a group thing.

## Layout

In this phase, you define how the navigation system will work at the page level. 

    * This phase focuses on the page-level design of the navigation system.
    * It's about creating a clear and logical narrative that guides users through the site.
    * Page layout plays a crucial role in shaping the user's navigational experience.


Navigation provides the narrative through your site. It’s the story people follow to get the information they want. If the navigation concept is your premise and the site structure is your plot, you start telling the story with page layout.

## Presentation

The culmination of all your plans, this phase is when you create final designs for your navigation. 

    * This final phase involves creating the visual design of the navigation system.
    * It emphasizes the importance of visual elements like color, texture, and style in conveying information and enhancing usability.
    * The visual treatment of navigation is considered essential for its perception and effectiveness.

People like context-rich information. How we find, organize, and even understand information is influenced by how it’s displayed. Content that is presented with color, texture, and style has relevance to our work and to our lives. The visual treatment of navigation is not merely a “niceto-have,” but crucial to its perception and use. It can be the difference between usable and not usable, between credible and not credible, or between found and not-found.

## What is AALP?

AALP stands for **Analysis, Architecture, Layout, and Presentation**. It's a framework for navigation design, as described in the provided text. It breaks down the navigation design process into four distinct phases, emphasizing a structured and methodical approach.

* Start with a deep understanding of the problem.
* Establish a solid organizational structure.
* Design clear and logical page layouts.
* Create visually appealing and functional navigation elements.
