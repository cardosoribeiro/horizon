## Analysis

## Architecture

The purpose here is to determine how to best structure the site. Even if the site’s architecture already exists, you’ll still need to understand basic principles of organization and categorization to design an appropriate navigation. 

## Layout

In this phase, you define how the navigation system will work at the page level. 

## Presentation

The culmination of all your plans, this phase is when you create final designs for your navigation.
